# Timeline Project
A personal project to document my life's events. As someone who does not post on social media often but loves photographing events, I wanted to create a place where I could post for my future self to look back on. I hope to continue adding events to this timeline as a passion project that mixes my love for photography, journaling, and storytelling.
