    <h3 class="timeline__date">July 31, 2023</h3>
    <p class="timeline__paragraph">
      Sarah and I spent the day together before she leave to London to do her Master's program in art history for a year. Sarah and I had lunch at Up Thai in the Upper East Side and then got to visit some of the places I'm drawing from my design internship. We went to Ralph's and got iced teas and then went to sit on the grass in Central Park. I brought my picnic blanket from Penn. Probabaly the most useful piece of merch I've gotten from college. We chatted about whatever and everything from my autoimmune disorder (Sarah was one of the first to know), relationships, how we're excited but also nervous for the next year, how we are glad that we get to do this next year together in our programs even though we'll be an ocean apart. A fluffy brown dog ran up to us in the middle of my cry session and Sarah thought it was a bear. We then went to the Museum of Natural History, both our first time going since we usually go to art museums. We got to live our "Night at the Museum" dreams and got to see "Dexter" and "Dum Dum". We also got to see the new Gilder Center; it's so calming and beautiful. We then sat on a bench outside and chatted before taking the subway. We talked about how we thought a day felt like there would've been more time together. We reflected on how we kept in touch through the pandemic. How she would show me around her town on the walk to get coffee as I was in my dorm cooking dinner. That time we made gnocchi together on Zoom. We chatted about my plans to visit London in the spring or after my graduation. I miss Sarah and living so close and having random conversations in her living room.

      Louis returned home for a weekend and we went out to all-you-can-eat sushi with our parents and our cousin Nick. I made the mistake of ordering too many California rolls and got full before the sashimi even arrived. I don't think my family will let me live that one down any time we got out for sushi or KBBQ.

    <h3 class="timeline__date">July, 15, 2023</h3>
    <p class="timeline__paragraph">
      Met up with Louise, Ani, and Vanessa in the city. Louise and I got brunch with her sister Lucy and Roxanne at an Italian place. We chatted about how we are all in our final year of our Master program. It's comforting to know that we are all going through similar things and Louise and I are both studying product design. It's sometimes weird to think that I am now older than Louise was when we first met. I met her in my freshmen year right before the pandemic through our undergrad Architecture group where she became my mentor. Afterwards, I met up with Ani and we got to catch up near NOHO. We spent the day window shopping and got ice cream from Morganstern Bananas. It was delicious especially on one of the hottest days. I learned that Ani and I have similar things that catch our eye in terms of style and asthetics. I felt so relaxed not having an agenda and just going wherever. After Ani left to catch her train, I visited Vanessa's new apartment! She showed me the vlog recap of senior year she was working on before we went to the Thai restaurant by her place. We had a great conversation about what we want to do in our careers and how we want to build in being creative into those role. It made us excited about the future. I feel so priviledged to have friends from the very beginning of my college experience. I met Vanessa the first week of college on a tour that the school organized to visit Chinatown. We found out we both lived in the same dorm and got involved in the theatre on campus.

    <h3 class="timeline__date">July 4, 2023</h3>
    <p class="timeline__paragraph">
      The 4th is a timemarker for my family. The past few years I have returned home for the summers to spend time with my parents and cousins. The 4th is the only summer holiday when my parents take off from work, so it is a day for just us. The day is usually slow, relaxed, and unplanned besides grilling and fireworks. Going to Tanner Park on this day is a tradition. After dinner in our backyard, we go to Tanner Park for live music, the boardwalk, and fireworks at sunset. I also taught Mom how to take a .5 selfie. This 4th I reflected on how much of a difference I feel about where I am at in life compared to last year.
